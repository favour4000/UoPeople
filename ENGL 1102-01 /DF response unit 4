                              AI and Global Job Loss

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming industries across the globe, and while it enhances efficiency and productivity, it is also contributing significantly to job losses in various sectors. AI and automation are rapidly replacing repetitive and routine tasks traditionally performed by humans. According to a report by the World Economic Forum (2023), while AI is expected to create 69 million new jobs, it may also displace 83 million positions by 2027, leading to a net job loss of 14 million. This shift is particularly evident in industries like manufacturing, retail, and customer service, where automation technologies are now performing roles once handled by human workers.

McKinsey & Company (2022) also highlights that AI adoption is accelerating post-pandemic, with sectors such as banking and healthcare increasingly using AI-powered systems for fraud detection, diagnostics, and virtual assistants. This technological shift is reducing the demand for certain clerical and administrative jobs. Additionally, Brynjolfsson and McAfee (2021) argue that the rapid pace of AI development often outpaces workforce retraining efforts, leaving many workers without the necessary skills to transition into new roles.
Although AI can lead to innovation and job creation in tech-driven sectors, the displacement it causes is a pressing concern. A proactive approach involving upskilling and education is essential to ensure that the workforce can adapt to evolving demands.
