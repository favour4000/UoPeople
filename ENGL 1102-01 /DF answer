Applying the Elements of Effective Writing.
Original Paragraph (from MindTools):
“Time management is the process of organizing and planning how to divide your time between different activities. Good time management enables you to work smarter – not harder – so that you get more done in less time, even when time is tight and pressures are high. Failing to manage your time damages your effectiveness and causes stress” (MindTools, n.d., para. 1).
Rewritten in My Own Words:
Time management means effective organization and scheduling your time to help you manage multiple tasks efficiently. With good time management skills, you can accomplish more in less time, poor time management skills can lead to a reduction in productivity.
Writing effectively needs six essential elements they are;
1. Clarity: Express your ideas in an easy-to-understand way, in a straightforward explanation.
2. Conciseness: Avoid irrelevant words, keep the message brief.
3. Coherence: It helps the ideas to flow logically, making each sentence support the concept of time management.
4. Correctness: Make sure the grammar, spelling, and sentence structure, boost readability.
5. Elaboration: Add useful details to make the message more informative.
6. Engagement: Capture the reader's attention, by relating the topic to real-life stress, making it more relatable.
In conclusion, applying these elements allows the writer to communicate more and leave a significant long-lasting impression.
