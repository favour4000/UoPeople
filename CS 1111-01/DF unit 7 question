In this assignment, you will delve into the fundamental concepts of programming paradigms, specifically structured, functional, and object-oriented programming. You will explore how each paradigm shapes the organization of code and influences problem-solving approaches. Furthermore, you will be able to apply your knowledge in a practical scenario. 

Define and discuss the core principles of Structured, Functional, and Object-Oriented Programming. How does each paradigm influence the organization of code and the approach to problem-solving? Provide examples to illustrate these principles.  
Imagine you are tasked with designing a new software solution. Discuss the steps you would take in the problem analysis and design phases to ensure the efficiency and resilience of the final product. Highlight specific design principles and methodologies you would apply and explain their importance. 
Your Discussion should be a minimum of 500 words in length and not more than 750 words. Please include a word count. Following the APA standard, use references and in-text citations for the textbook and any other sources.â€¯    

End your discussion post with one question related to the concepts learned in this unit, from which your colleagues can formulate a response or generate further discussion.
